```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(rtabulator)
```

With the setup option `movable_rows_connected_tables` you can move rows between two or more tables:

```{r}
sender_df <- head(iris, 3)
empty_df <- head(iris, 0)

tab_sender <- tabulator(
  sender_df,
  tabulator_options(
    movable_rows  = TRUE,
    movable_rows_connected_tables = "#table-receiver",
    movable_rows_receiver = "add",
    movable_rows_sender = "delete",
    placeholder = "All rows moved"
  ),
  element_id = "table-sender"
)
tab_receiver <- tabulator(
  empty_df,
  tabulator_options(
    placeholder = "Drag rows here"
  ),
  element_id = "table-receiver"
)

tab_sender
tab_receiver
```

**Note**

In some browsers _moving rows functionality_ does not seem to work at the moment.
