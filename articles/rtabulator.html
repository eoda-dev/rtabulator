<p>rtabulator provides R bindings for <a href="https://tabulator.info/" class="external-link">Tabulator JS</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of rtabulator is to make it easy to create elegant and
interactive tables in markdown documents and <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/" class="external-link">Shiny</a> applications. Furthermore, it
supports creating spreadsheets with multiple sheets.</p>
